hhuan143 contains various sensor setup code for components:

Lab1 - flex and piezo sensor to play differnt tones via audio amplifier and speaker

Lab2 - encoder, capacitive touch and ultrasonic sensor setup

Lab3 - calibration of accelerometer, magnetometer, and gyroscope of an IMU

Lab4 - located in pourfect_lab4/Lab4/lab4/src

features a sensor fusion feedback loop for IMU. Integrating gyroscope data while using accelerometer and magnetometer feedback to correct drift for accurate real-time orientation estimation.
